In thise file you will be able to read our findings from mini project 1 part 2.
All findings were done by sending 10.000 datagrams to an echo server.

- 1 Local connection on single machine
On local machine we found no lost, duplicated or reordered datagrams. This was what we expected, as there shouldn't be any loss, duplicate, or reorder when sending
from and to the same computer, because the "places" they can be lost, duplicated or reordered is very limited.

- 2 Wifi
On our final test we had no lost, duplicated or reordered datagrams. We did expect some loss on wifi due to packets having to travel from one computer to another. 
On an earlier test we did lose 2 datagrams out of the 10.000 send though.

- 3 Ethernet
On the ethernet we had no lost, duplicated or reordered datagrams. We did expect some loss on the ethernet due to same reason as wifi, but expected less here due to an ethernet being
better connected than wifi. 

- Internet across multiple nets
We have not tested this, as we had no one in the group able to do a port-fowarding.
